      <h2 id="static-and-dynamic-binding">Static and Dynamic Binding</h2>

<p><strong>Static binding</strong> is for overloaded methods while <strong>dynamic binding</strong> is for 
overridden methods. Always keep in mind what class each object is. An instance
of a child object can be declared as a type of the parent object. Whenever there are overloaded
methods, you need to call the method that belongs to the <em>type</em> of the variable.
Remember that overloaded methods will be called based on the parameters passed, 
regardless of whichever class is being called. If you declare an object with a 
parent class’s data type, but use the child class’s constructor, that object
will only have access to the members of the parent class.</p>

<p>You can always cast between hierarchies.</p>

<p>If an object variable is declared as a parent class’s type,
but is initialized with the child class’s constructor and the child class has an
overridden method, when calling that method, the child class’s type will be used.
Overloaded methods are called based on the object’s constructor while overridden
methods are called based on the object’s declared data type.</p>

<p>All that can be confusing, I know.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h2>

<p><strong>Interfaces</strong> are classes that contain only abstract methods. Interfaces are
<strong>implemented</strong> by another class. The implementing class <em>must</em> define the 
methods that were declared in the interface.</p>

<p>Interfaces are defined with the
keyword <code class="highlighter-rouge">interface</code>. Using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">abstract</code> keyword before each method of an
interface is redundant. Do not use it. By default, fields are public, static,
and final, so using the keywords <code class="highlighter-rouge">public</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">static</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code> is redundant.</p>

<p>There are two other types of methods that can be a part of the interface. The
first is a static method. The other is the default method. Both can be
implemented. These methods cannot be reimplemented by the implementing class.
You <em>cannot</em> create an object of an interface. You can only instantiate an
object of an implementing class.</p>

<p>Remember to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@Override</code> tag before each method’s definition in the 
implementing class.</p>

<p>Interfaces were introduced because Java only supports single inheritance. You
can implement more than one interface. When you implement more than one
interface, be sure to define all the methods from all of the interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="other-important-notes">Other Important Notes</h2>

<p>Test 2 will be on March 3rd. Most of it will be on content covered between test
1 and test 2; however, there will be questions on content covered before test 1.</p>

<p>For assignment 3, do not hard-code the ID for each vehicle. The ID should be 
automatically generated.</p>

<p>I was absent on Thursday due to illness, so I could not take very good notes.</p>
