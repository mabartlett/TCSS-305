<p>What you've discovered is the product of Marcus'<!--
--><span title="Yeah, a possessive 's' after a word ending in 's.' Wanna fight me over it?">s
</span> note-taking for the Winter quarter of TCSS 305 with 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/athirai/" target="_blank">Professor
Athirai Irissappane</a>. Yes, that ceaseless keyboard-slapping during class is
actually being put to good use. In the spirit of mutual aid, I've decided that
everybody would benefit from taking a peek at my notes. A good portion of it is
copied from the lecture slides and the rest of it is sloppy as all hell, but 
hey, it's free!</p>

<p>Click one of the links in the navigation bar to start studying.</p>

<p>This website, like the school quarter that produced it, is still unfinished.
In addition to adding more notes, I also feel like this boring landing page needs something more, 
like maybe some stock photos of 20-something-year-olds drinking coffee. People 
love those! Stay tuned and check in every week to see what's new. For those who
are curious, this site was made with the static site generator
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and all the notes
were taken in the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
format.

<p>Good luck on your exams and <span title="Rise of Skywalker was really bad.">
may the Force be with you.</span></p>
